# tinyconverters

This repository includes a number of microservices that can be used to perform small transmogrifications between file formats, data formats, types, etc. For example, there are scripts that move information to and from json or switch from hex, and stuff like that. There are also a couple of linters and copiers to help validate that the changes are proper.
